# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Space-Models

🔹 Project Overview — Advanced Time Series Forecasting
This project builds a custom State Space Model (SSM) using the Kalman Filter to forecast complex time series data. Instead of relying only on ARIMA or Prophet, it models hidden states such as trend, seasoality, and noise explicitly.

The workflow includes:
* Designing the state and observation equations
* Estimating parameters using Kalman filtering and smoothing
* Generating forecasts and uncertainty intervals
* Comparing results against a baseline SARIMA model using RMSE, MAE, and likelihood
The goal is to develop production-quality forecasting pipelines while gaining strong practical understanding of dynamic systems modeling used in finance, energy, and econometrics.

🔹 Summary
This project applies State Space Models and Kalman Filtering to forecast complex time series by capturing trend, seasonality, and hidden patterns. The custom model is evaluated against SARIMA benchmarks using metrics like RMSE and MAE, with a focus on building accurate, production-ready forecasting systems and strengthening understanding of dynamic time series modeling.

🔹 Conclusion
This project demonstrates that State Space Models with Kalman Filtering provide flexible and powerful forecasting compared to traditional methods like SARIMA, especially for complex and non-stationary time series. By explicitly modeling hidden components such as trend and seasonality, the approach delivers improved accuracy, interpretability, and uncertainty estimation, making it well-suited for real-world forecasting applications in finance, energy, and operations.
